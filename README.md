# Ping Monitor

This **Ping Monitor** is a Python-based application designed for continuous monitoring of a given website or host IP address. It measures latency, logs results, sends customisable email alerts, plays audible alert notifications, and shows real-time desktop notifications.

## 🚀 Overview

The Ping Monitor monitors network performance for reliability by:

- Resolving website URLs to their corresponding IP addresses.
- Measuring precise latency values in repetitive intervals.
- Alerting via email when specific ping threshold values are exceeded.
- Logging timestamp, latency, and downtime information into easily readable CSV files (`ping_results.csv`).
- Triggering desktop notifications and sound alerts if latency values cross defined critical thresholds.

## 📦 Installation

To set up and run your Ping Monitor project:

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:LlewAdamson-tengen/PingMonitor.git
   cd ping-monitor
   ```

2. Prep your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   make setup-env
   ```


3. Create and activate the virtual environment (managed by Makefile):
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

---

## 🟢 Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
make run
```

Your Ping Monitor begins by outputting ping values to your terminal and logging every ping into `ping_results.csv`.

During an alert event, notifications (email, desktop pop-ups, audible alerts) are triggered to inform immediately of potential issues.

---

## 🧹 Cleaning & Reset

To clean and reset your entire environment:

```bash
make clean
```

This command:

- Deletes your current Python virtual environment (`.venv`) 
- Clears Python caches (`__pycache__`)
- Reinstalls all requirements and runs the monitor fresh

## 🗂 Logging Results 

Ping records are logged into `ping_results.csv`, structured clearly:

Example:
2025-03-11 13:52:48,21.579,0 2025-03-11 13:58:26,3458.861,0 2025-03-11 14:10:26,5566.672,0 2025-03-11 14:30:08,23.563,1 2025-03-11 14:30:28,24.035,3 ...


- **warnings** count consecutive pings above your defined threshold.
- Actual timestamps provide clear records of ping performance and historical data.
